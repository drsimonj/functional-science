## What is Dropbox?

> "One place for all your stuff, wherever you are."

> "Dropbox is a home for all your photos, docs, videos, and files. Anything you add to Dropbox will automatically show up on all your computers, phones and even the Dropbox website â€” so you can access your stuff from anywhere."

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/tour)

## How to get your own Dropbox

Create an account at <https://www.dropbox.com>

## Basic Usage

Think of Dropbox like any other folder on your computer.

It's easy to:

- Store files
- Alter files
- Create folders

## Collaborating with others

We can let other people see and download our files or folders with the "Share" feature.

We can share complete access to our folders by inviting people by email.

## Test Yourself

In groups of two or more, elect one person to create a folder in their Dropbox.

Have this person invite everyone else to collaborate in this folder.

Have someone else add a word document to this folder.

Everyone else, take turns adding to this file, or adding new files/folders.

Can you see how to leave comments for yourself and each other?

## Bonus - Version History

> By default, Dropbox saves all deleted and previous versions of your files for 30 days. ^[Dropbox Help](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/113)^
