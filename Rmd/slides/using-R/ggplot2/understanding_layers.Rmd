## Layers

When we add (`+`) geoms to a plot, this is done in layers.

geoms added earlier in the plot chain will appear **behind** geoms added later.

Imagine drawing each geom on a plastic sheet. When you add it to the plot, you put it down on top of the previous one.

## Examples

Here the points are added ontop of the line:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = wt)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "red")
```

## Examples

Here, the line is added ontop of the points:

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = wt)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "red") +
  geom_line(size = 2)
```

## Some uses

Understanding layers is important from the point of view that you will often make simple errors.

But carefully layering our geoms can also prove useful for many reasons.

## Examples

Let's examine ozone levels in May using the `airquality` data set.

```{r, message=F}
library(dplyr)
d <- airquality %>% filter(Month == 5)
head(d)
```


## Example

Let's draw points:

```{r, warning=F, fig.width=8}
ggplot(d, aes(x = Day, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Example

How might we make these large white points with black outlines?

## Example

```{r, fig.width=8, warning=F}
ggplot(d, aes(x = Day, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_point(color = "white", size = 2)
```

## Test Yourself

Add a line to the previous plot.

Make sure that the dots appear on top of the line.

Bonus: change the `linetype` aesthetic on the line to equal 2.

## Test Yourself

Answer

```{r, fig.width=8, warning=F}
ggplot(d, aes(x = Day, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_line(linetype = 2) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_point(color = "white", size = 2)
```
