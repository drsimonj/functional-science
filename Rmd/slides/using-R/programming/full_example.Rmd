## Motivation

Data collected........... check!

Data cleaned............. 

Big job when cleaning is to check whether there are any values outside of a valid range.

## Example

We have multiple columns, each with different possible values.

We can't look at every cell.

What to do?

## What we'll do

- Write a function to check whether values of a vector are acceptable, and indicate the location of anything that is not.
- Create a list object that will provide information about what is acceptable for each column.
- Iterate through our data to check each column and save the results.
